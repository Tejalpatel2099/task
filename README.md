**Professors Appointment Planner**

Problem it Solves

Students often struggle to keep track of professors’ office hours, class meetups, and ad-hoc availability. Office hours are posted  which makes it confusing and time-consuming for students to find the right time to connect with their professors.

**What Information it Shows**
* A consolidated dashboard of professors’ office hours (pulled from different sources)
* Real-time availability status (e.g., “Available Now”, “Busy Until 3:00 PM”)
* Meeting location details (office room, Zoom link, or meeting spot)
* Quick actions like “Copy Location”, “Join Zoom”, or “Send Email”

**How it Makes a Student’s Day Easier**
* Saves time by aggregating all professor availability in one place
* Reduces stress of missing or misremembering office hours
* Enables smarter planning with real-time updates
* Encourages students to seek help more frequently, improving academic performance
